# 🚦 Traffic Sense: Visionary Traffic Control

## 📘 Research Paper Overview
This repository contains my published research paper
on intelligent traffic management using computer vision
and machine learning techniques.

---

## 🏗 System Architecture

The system processes real-time traffic camera footage
to detect vehicles and control traffic signals dynamically.

---

## 🚦 Traffic Density & Lane Prioritization

Vehicle count is calculated per lane and the lane
with maximum density is given higher green signal time.

---

## 🚑 Emergency Vehicle Detection (YOLO)

YOLO is used to detect emergency vehicles like ambulances
and prioritize them at intersections.
